Welcome to the Big Data analytic project using Apache Spark.

 

 Instructions :

 

    * This project needs to be completed in spark environment using either Scala or PySpark
    * The schema of the dataset needs to match as given in the next section.
    * The file names to be saved should match EXACTLY the name provided in the instruction including the file extension. i.e. 'file_name.csv'
    * The records should be ORDERED as per the instruction.
    * All the files should be saved along with header information.

 

    Candidates Using Online IDE:

 

        * Click on Project > Install to install the necessary packages.
        * Once the HackerRank environment is up, use the terminal to bring up scala or pyspark.

        * Write your code in answer.py file [For PySpark] (or) you can directly write the code in terminal and execute it 

        * If you're using terminal type 'pyspark' in terminal to bring up pyspark. Similarly, type 'spark-shell' to bring up scala.

        * After done with the coding don't forget to execute the answer.py file using  python3  answer.py  in the terminal.

        * To check your answer run using Project > Run (or) Run Tests. Submit the test after the expected result has achieved.

 

Data Preparation :

 

Before starting with analysis, data needs to be cleaned and prepared. The needed steps are detailed below.

Step 1 - Read the raw data from 'Automobile_data.csv' and store it in a data frame with the below-mentioned schema. The column name and datatypes should match as given below

Step 2 - Check for records with missing value in the column. 

Step 3 - Check for the na values (here it is '?') and fill it with mean (or) mode according to column type.

Step 4 - Convert the price , horsepower ,.etc column(s) to numerical(double) data-type & drop the price column with 'na' values.

Step 5 - Save the cleaned file to 'final_data.csv'. The data available at this step will be used for analytics.
